# Introduction/Roadmap to NLP

NLP is used where some of the independent features are made of text, for example in Spam classification in Email. Here we classify mail as a Spam or Not Spam.

In this scenario some of the independent features we have are Email subject and Email body. And our output feature is whether its Spam or not i.e., Spam/Ham.

In this scenario, with text data it will be difficult for a model to do classification. As model cannot understand human language. Here its in English, it can be in Chinese, spanish, etc.

We have techniques which can convert these text into meaningful vectors. Vectors are like numbers and those vectors represent some meaningful information w.r.t to the texts. And whenever your input data is in form of text/sentences we use NLP (Natural Language Processing). So NLP is used to process text data and make model understand how to solve these kind of problems.

## Text pre-processing

#### Step 1: Cleaning the input
Cleaning text data for using in Model. 

Techniques: Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stemming, Stop words. 

#### Step 2: Convert input text to vectors
Vector should be able to capture the context of the statement.

Techniques: Bag of words, TF-IDFs, Unigram, Bigrams

#### Step 3: Convert input text to vectors (Advanced)
Deep Learning Techniques: Word2Vec, Avgword2Vec

#### Step 4: Neural networks
Deep Learning Techniques: RNN, LSTM, 

Used for Spam classification, text summarization, etc.

#### Step 5: Deep Learning Techniques
Word embeddings

#### Step 6: Transformers

#### Step 7: BERT

As we go from step 1 to step 7 => Accuracy and size increases.

Step 1 to 3 => Part of ML. Libraries like nltk, spacy, etc.

Step 4 => Deep Learning. Libraries like Tensorflow(created by Google) and Pytorch(created by FB).

Step 5 to 7 => Neural networks

## Practical Usecases of NLP
- Spelling correction
- Auto generate sentences in email
- Google translate
- Image detection (Google photos, video)
- Text to image, text to video, etc.
- Alexa
- Google Assitant
