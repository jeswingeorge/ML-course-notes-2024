# Tokenization in NLP

## Basic terminologies

1. __Corpus__ - Paragraph is usually called as Corpus.
2. __Documents__ - Sentences
3. __Vocabulary__ - All unique words available in the paragraph(corpus).
4. __Words__ - Words in corpus are called as words itself.

## Tokenization

Conside this paragraph(Corpus): 
> My name is Jeswin and I like to play football. And my favorite football player is Messi. I like coding also.

__Tokenization__ is a process in which we take either a paragraph or sentences and we convert these into smaller parts known as Tokens. When we perform tokenization on the above paragraph, the tokens that are generated are called sentences(or documents). We can also convert the above paragraph into words.

When we do tokenization from a paragraph to sentence we will look into these kind of characters like full stop(.) or exclamation(!). We can do this with python also.

1st sentence/document => My name is Jeswin and I like to play football  
2nd sentence/document => And my favorite football player is Messi  

Now we can do tokenization on a sentence and can convert each word in that sentence into a seperate word. So in short, __words can also be a token and sentences can also be a token__.

Tokenization is a part of text-preprocessing and it is required because each and every word can be converted into vector.

Consider these sentences:
> I like to drink Apple Juice. My friend likes Mango Juice. 

So above there are 2 sentences (since 2 full stops) and we will perform tokenization and the tokens present here will be sentences.

So there will be two tokens:
1. I like to drink Apple Juice
2. My friend likes Mango Juice

So now from these sentences we can count the total number of words i.e., 11. 
But number of unique words are: 10. 

So in the paragraph above the vocbulary (unique words) are the 10 unique words.

### What is the difference between syntax and semantics?
Syntax is the structure of language, such as word order and sentence composition. Semantics is the meaning of words. Both syntax and semantics can provide valuable context clues to aid readers in comprehending unfamiliar words.

### An example of a semantic cue
To use semantic cues, readers look at the meaning of the words surrounding an unfamiliar word to try and determine the meaning of the unfamiliar word.

Example sentence:

Mary rode a 'palomino' but her sisters rode brown horses.

- Both Mary and her sisters are riding, so a palomino must be something that can be ridden.
- Since Mary's sisters are riding horses, a 'palomino' may be a specific kind of horse.

Both of these are semantic clues, using the meaning of words surrounding the unfamiliar word.
